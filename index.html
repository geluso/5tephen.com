        <h1>Professional Work by Steve Geluso</h1>

        <p>
        Hello, I'm Steve Geluso, a bike enthusiast, Software Engineer and Web Developer living in Seattle, WA.
        I earned my Bachelors degree in Computer Science at the University of Washington. I've
        worked at large companies, small independent firms, and freelanced. I like to
        work on expiremental, interactive projects that require custom work there may not be easy libraries for.

        <p>
          You simply must visit 
          <a href="http://awol-in-ptown.com">awol-in-ptown.com</a>
          to see some of my best work. It's an interactive site filled with
          beautiful sights and sounds promoting a movie, 
          <a href="http://theimmortalaugustusgladstone.com">The Immortal Augustus Gladstone</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          This site was built for Robyn Miller, co-creator of the best-selling video game Myst.
          It features a giga-pixel photo of Downtown Portland, built up from 67,325 image tiles.
          Players pan and zoom through the photo using 
          <span style="color: #00ffff">S</span><span style="color: #33ffff">O</span><span style="color: #9999ff">N</span><span style="color: #cc99ff">A</span><span style="color: #ff99cc">R</span><span style="color: #ff9966">V</span><span style="color: #ff9933">I</span><span style="color: #ff9933">S</span><span style="color: #ff9933">I</span><span style="color: #ff9933">O</span><span style="color: #ffcc33">N</span>
          to find hidden images of characters and props from the movie.
        </p>

        <p>
          AWOL-in-P-Town is technically impressive because it's completely custom-built.
          No existing tile mapping tools gave us the degree of interactivity the site required.
          I devised our strategy to tile, pan and zoom through the images. The tedious process
          of editing a tile and propogating those changes through all zoom levels was streamlined
          by learning Photoshop's automated actions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Turn on your volume and visit AWOL in P-Town to experience it's immersiveness
          firsthand, then check out the movie site where you can watch trailers, listen
          to the soundtrack and find out where to watch the movie.

        <p>
        Here's a showcase of some of my own personal projects I've done for free and in
        my spare time. These projects have allowed me to practice skills I've been able
        to incorporate into my professional work.

              My own Javascript HTML5 canvas implemetnation of The Settlers of Catan.
              This is an experiment in programming board games. Programming the hexes was more
              challenging than I expected, even after referring
              <a href="http://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/">this excellent hex guide</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
              My version includes limited AI that will build roads, settlements and cities, but
              they're not very competitive. Eventually I plan to experiment with using different
              geometries for the game board. I'd lke to generate random polygons instead of always
              using hexes. I'm interested to see what will need to change in the program to accomodate
              such a change.

              This is an image association game that plays just like Apples-to-Apples
              with images instead of words.
              Players are dealt five random images. Players match images in their hand with an
              image dealt to the center of the table. Players take turns acting as a judge that determines
              what image is the best "match." It's fun!
            </p>

            <p>
              This site was built by Fred and Jules. I came in to the project a few years ago
              when they posted a message asking for help programming. Over the years I've helped
              maintain the server and we're currently prototyping an Android app.

              Here is my own personal site where I sell
              hand-stitched T-shirts with the Rainier logo. This is the first time
              site I've built that accepts orders and processes payments. It's a simple, single-purpose
              site.
            </p>

            <p>
              The site features instagram integration which shows pictures including a
              hashtag of photos of people wearing the shirt and the shirts being made.
            </p>
              
            <p>
              In addtion to the site I also designed and ordered printed vinyl stickers to
              promote the site.

              This game acts as an ongoing sketchpad where I can practice game
              programming techniques. Most recently I've been interested in simulating AI movement.
              I'm using the popular
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids">boids</a>
              algorithm for cow movement. It's not perfect yet.
            </p>

            <p>
              I'm excited about the opportunity to build a large world where players can visit
              different towns, talk to characters and find quests.
            </p>

            <p>
              At it's core, this is a light-hearted story-telling project. It's potential is
              infinite and it will never be complete.
