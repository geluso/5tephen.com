        <h1>Professional Work by Steve Geluso</h1>

        <p>
        Hello, I'm Steve Geluso, a bike enthusiast, Software Engineer and Web Developer living in Seattle, WA.
        I earned my Bachelors degree in Computer Science at the University of Washington. I've
        worked at large companies, small independent firms, and freelanced. I like to
        work on expiremental, interactive projects that require custom work there may not be easy libraries for.

        <p>
          You simply must visit 
          <a href="http://awol-in-ptown.com">awol-in-ptown.com</a>
          to see some of my best work. It's an interactive site filled with
          beautiful sights and sounds promoting a movie, 
          <a href="http://theimmortalaugustusgladstone.com">The Immortal Augustus Gladstone</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          This site was built for Robyn Miller, co-creator of the best-selling video game Myst.
          It features a giga-pixel photo of Downtown Portland, built up from 67,325 image tiles.
          Players pan and zoom through the photo using 
          <span style="color: #00ffff">S</span><span style="color: #33ffff">O</span><span style="color: #9999ff">N</span><span style="color: #cc99ff">A</span><span style="color: #ff99cc">R</span><span style="color: #ff9966">V</span><span style="color: #ff9933">I</span><span style="color: #ff9933">S</span><span style="color: #ff9933">I</span><span style="color: #ff9933">O</span><span style="color: #ffcc33">N</span>
          to find hidden images of characters and props from the movie.
        </p>

        <p>
          AWOL-in-P-Town is technically impressive because it's completely custom-built.
          No existing tile mapping tools gave us the degree of interactivity the site required.
          I devised our strategy to tile, pan and zoom through the images. The tedious process
          of editing a tile and propogating those changes through all zoom levels was streamlined
          by learning Photoshop's automated actions. Recording macros is awesome!
        </p>

        <p>
          Turn on your volume and visit AWOL in P-Town to experience it's immersiveness
          firsthand, then check out the movie site where you can watch trailers, listen
          to the soundtrack and find out where to watch the movie.

        <p>
        Here's a showcase of some of my own personal projects I've done for free and in
        my spare time. These projects have allowed me to practice skills I've been able
        to incorporate into my professional work. Be warned, while I'm not on the job I
        only develop for Chrome.

              My own Javascript HTML5 canvas implemetnation of The Settlers of Catan.
              This is an experiment in programming board games. Programming the hexes was more
              challenging than I expected, even after referring
              <a href="http://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/">this excellent hex guide</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
              My version includes limited AI that will build roads, settlements and cities, but
              they're not very competitive. Eventually I plan to experiment with using different
              geometries for the game board. I'd lke to generate random polygons instead of always
              using hexes. I'm interested to see what will need to change in the program to accomodate
              such a change.

              This is an image association game that plays like Apples-to-Apples
              with images instead of words.
              One image is dealt to the center of the table and each player chooses
              an image from their hand that they think pairs well with it, for whatever reason.
              Players take turns judging which pair makes the best match. It's fun!

              This site was built by Fred and Jules. I came in a few years ago
              when there was a message asking for help. I've added new features and helped
              maintain the server. We're currently prototyping an Android app.

            <p>
              Others will need to be present for a game to begin. Invite friends!

              Here is my own personal site where I sell
              hand-stitched T-shirts with the Rainier logo. This is the first time
              site I've built that accepts orders and processes payments. It's a simple, single-purpose
              site.
            </p>

            <p>
              The site features instagram integration which shows pictures including a
              hashtag of photos of people wearing the shirt and the shirts being made.

              In addtion to the site I also designed and ordered printed vinyl stickers to
              promote the site.

              This game acts as an ongoing sketchpad where I can practice game
              programming techniques. Most recently I've been interested in simulating AI movement.
              I'm using the popular
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids">boids</a>
              algorithm for cow movement. It's not perfect yet.

            <p>
              I'm excited about the opportunity to build a large world where players can visit
              different towns, talk to characters and find quests.

            <p>
              At it's core, this is a light-hearted story-telling project. It's potential is
              infinite and it will never be complete.

        <h1>Custom Image Manipulation</h1>

        <p>
        I spend some time using ffmpeg, bash, Python, javascript and Photoshop to explore
        image manipulation and video programming. I'm interested in panoramas,
        scene detection, subtitles, video effects and supercuts.
        </p>

        <p>
        Many of these projects are inspired by wondering, "what would it look like if...?"
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h1>Panorama Extraction</h1>

        <p>
        Here's a fun interactive video expirement. I wrote a javascript tool that takes
        still frames from a movie shot and stitches them together into a panorama. The
        movie shot is from Rushmore, where the camera pans steadily across audience
        members sitting in a row.
        </p>

        <p>
        The panorama is generated by taking left-most column of pixels from each frame
        and drawing them next to each other. It could be modified to take the center row
        of pixels, or the right-most, it really doesn't matter. The effect is a smearing
        of all those columns next to each other onto a permanent canvas.
        </p>

        <p>
        I'd like to improve this by adding more multiple cursors that pan across the
        screen at once. Ideally, it should be possible to show every character sitting
        in the row moving smoothly all at once. Perfectly looped too. This would be hard,
        but I'm not convinced it's impossible.
        </p>

        <p>
        Clicking on the still image below will take you to the interactive page where you
        can play with the image being generated in real time.
        </p>

          </a>
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h1>N-Frame Averager</h1>

        <p>
        Here's a fun one. I wrote a script that explodes a video into it's individual frames,
        then iterates over each frame and rewrites it into the average of itself and it's N
        nearest neighbors. This produces an effect that smoothes out images over time and
        tunes out things that don't appear on the screen for long. It works well for
        time lapse video of scenes with a constant background.
        </p>

        <p>
        Here's a video that shows the averager running at four different settings. There's
        the original time-lapse footage of me driving, then each frame is averaged at two,
        four, and 20 frames. You can see how the constant features of the sky, road and
        landscape smooth out as the average window is widened. Passing cars dissapear as
        N is increased. The shadow of the truck on the road is fun to watch.
        </p>

        <p>
        Big thank you to pretty blue skies in Eastern Washington for this one.
